# Challenge-Three

In this weeks challenge we had to create prompts to generate a password using special characters, numbers, upper and lower case letters, and the length of the password had to be between 8-128 characters. This is accomplished whenever we hit the generate password button on the webpage we are prompted with how many characters we want in the password, if we would like any lowercase letters in the password, if we would like any uppercase letters in the password, if we want any special characters, and if we'd like any numbers. If we input the incorrect number of characters or fail to select any of the character options we are greeted with an undefine message in the password generator box.

I was having a hard time with this assignment and was able to find two videos to help guide me through the assignment as a reference for how to complete the project:

the first video was from a student: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2jfGo7ztm8 

the second video was from a professor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4HUaiazDes
